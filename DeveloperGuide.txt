General information
----------------------
  - This project is basically two programs, ConfigWriter and reader, and
    an init script
  - ConfigWriter edits the configuration used by reader
  - reader uses the user configuration to set recording parameters
    and then records using the nidaqmx api
  - reader is ran as a init script located at /etc/init.d/reader
  - To reload the configuration for reader you need to relaunch the program
    either by power cycling the cDAQ-9136 or restarting/stopping and starting
    the init process using /etc/init.d/reader start/stop/restart
  - The folder structure for the cDAQ-9136 is hard-coded, so if you reinstall
    everything be sure to place it like so

    |-- /
        |-- etc
            |-- init.d
                |-- reader
        |-- home
            |-- admin
                |-- ConfigWriter
                    |-- ConfigWriter
                |-- reader
                    |-- reader
                    |-- config
                        |-- config.ini
                    |-- output

  - Also if you reinstalled be sure to install the FTP server and SSH server
    on the cDAQ-9136 using NI MAX. Also set the server time using NI MAX. It
    would be more accurate to connect the cDAQ-9136 to the internet and download
    a NTP client using the built-in package manager instead of manually setting
    the time.
